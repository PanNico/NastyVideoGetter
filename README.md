Retrives a video from a website and merges the parts.<br/>
Sometimes watching a video in streaming could be a pain in the ass, as my boss is used to say; the reason could be our connection indeed but 
most of the time the websites that offer these kind of services are very bad written, full of ads and download more than they should. 
This is the real reason why most of the time watching a video is such a pain (not every time I know and actually I don't care if you don't agree; for me it works).
<br/>What I was used to do was: I opened the browser's debugger, got the link of the video and then using wget I downloaded the video.
In the recent times, I noticed that most of the most interesting platforms of videostreaming ( ;) ) is starting to break the video on multiple files and map the chunk
to portion of the time bar of the player. I like it but I can't download 500 files to watch a porn! This application does the dirty job for me: downloads all the file and merge them.
